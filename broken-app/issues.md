# Broken App Issues

- Installed express and axios
- Changed the variable declarations at the top of the js file to *const*
- Added a *base_url* variable
- Added *(err)* to *catch*
- Added *app.use(expres.json());*
- Rewrote the **POST /** function so that it retrieves the intended results and forms an array
- Added a general error handler
